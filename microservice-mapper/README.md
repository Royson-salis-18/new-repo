# Microservice Mapper

**Real-time observability for Docker-based microservices — zero code changes required.**

Microservice Mapper connects to your EC2 instances over SSH, discovers your service topology from Docker Compose files and running containers, collects live telemetry, and renders an interactive 2D/3D dependency graph. Point it at a running stack and see your architecture come alive within seconds.

```
SSH into EC2 → Read Docker socket + /proc/net/tcp → Build live dependency graph → Visualize
```

---

## What It Does

- **Topology discovery** — reads your Compose file over SSH; discovers declared `depends_on` relationships
- **Runtime observation** — watches active TCP connections and parses container logs to confirm which services actually talk to each other
- **Live metrics** — CPU, memory, network I/O from Docker stats API, refreshed every 5 seconds
- **Root cause analysis** — when services degrade, an evidence-based scoring algorithm identifies the most likely root cause and traces the propagation path
- **Anomaly detection** — optional Python ML sidecar runs per-service IsolationForest models and feeds scores back into the graph
- **Traffic experiments** — built-in load test runner with experiment tracking
- **Embedded terminal** — SSH terminal into any target directly from the UI

## What It Is NOT

This is not a distributed tracing tool. There are no OpenTelemetry spans or request IDs. The "Traces" view shows SSH-sampled TCP connection snapshots from `/proc/net/tcp` — sampled at 5-second intervals, not per-request. No code changes are required in your applications.

---

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19, Vite 8, TypeScript |
| 2D Graph | `@xyflow/react` v12 (ReactFlow) |
| 3D View | Three.js + `@react-three/fiber` |
| Charts | Recharts |
| Animations | Framer Motion |
| Backend | Node.js 18+, Express 5, TypeScript |
| WebSocket | `ws` v8 (raw — no Socket.io) |
| SSH | `ssh2` v1 |
| Docker API | `dockerode` v4 |
| ML Pipeline | Python 3, scikit-learn (IsolationForest) |

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18, npm ≥ 9
- Docker ≥ 20.10 on target EC2 instances
- SSH key (`.pem`) with access to your EC2 instance
- Python 3.8+ (optional — only for the ML anomaly pipeline)

### Install & Run

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/Royson-salis-18/microservice-mapper.git
cd microservice-mapper

# Install all sub-projects
npm run install:all

# Start server + client
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**

The server runs on **:3001**. The Vite dev client runs on **:5173** and proxies `/api` + `/ws` to the backend.

### npm Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start server + client concurrently |
| `npm run server` | Start backend only |
| `npm run client` | Start Vite dev server only |
| `npm run build` | Production client build |
| `npm run install:all` | Install server, client, remote-collector, traffic-gen |
| `npm run traffic-gen` | Run traffic generator |
| `npm test` | Run the logic test suite (layouts, cycle handling, edge heat bands) |

---

## Adding a Target

1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Click **+ Add Project**
3. Fill in: Target ID, Display Name, EC2 Public IP, SSH Username, SSH Key Path
4. Click **Connect**

The server SSH connects immediately, reads the Compose file, discovers containers, and starts telemetry collection. Target configuration is saved to `data/remote_config.json` and persists across restarts.

### Supported Target Systems

| System | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Sock Shop** (Weave Works) | E-commerce demo | Traefik gateway, RabbitMQ queue |
| **Vertikal** | Financial trading sim | NGINX gateway, TimescaleDB |
| Any Docker Compose app | Custom | Works with any stack — type detection is heuristic-based |

---

## How It Works

### Hybrid Graph Model

The system combines two sources of truth:

| Source | How collected | Edge type |
|---|---|---|
| **Declared** | `depends_on` in `docker-compose.yml` read via SSH `cat` | Grey solid line — configured but not confirmed |
| **Observed (HTTP)** | Container log parsing — regex on access log lines | Cyan animated line — confirmed by actual HTTP traffic |
| **Observed (TCP)** | `/proc/net/tcp` polling | Drives edge "heat" (TCP observations/minute) |

An edge can be declared-only, observed-only, or both. This immediately surfaces:
- Declared deps with no runtime traffic (dead code / misconfiguration)
- Runtime traffic not in any Compose file (undocumented dependencies)

### Node ID Format

All nodes use a canonical format: `${targetId}:${serviceName}` — e.g., `sock-shop:catalogue`. This prevents ID mismatches between subsystems. See [wiki/04-id-system.md](./wiki/04-id-system.md).

### Persistence

State persists to `data/graph_db.json` (debounced 2-second write). Nodes not updated for 15+ minutes are automatically pruned (ghost prevention). Targets go `STALE` after 2 minutes and `OFFLINE` after 5 minutes without telemetry.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

When services fail, the RCA engine scores each failing node on:

| Signal | Weight | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Temporal precedence (earliest anomaly) | +0.30 | Failure propagates downstream; the first anomaly is most likely the origin |
| Container exited / critical status | +0.35 | Process exits are definitive failure signals |
| Degraded resource utilization | +0.15 | High CPU/memory is a secondary indicator |
| Observed runtime dependency | +0.20 | TCP traffic confirms the causal path exists |
| Downstream failure correlation | +0.15 | More failing downstream services = higher blast radius = stronger root cause signal |

Score ≥ 0.75 → `HIGH` confidence. RCA runs automatically every 5 seconds when failures are detected.

---

## ML Anomaly Detection (Optional)

A separate Python pipeline trains per-service IsolationForest models on historical metrics:

```bash
cd ml
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Collect baseline (run during normal operation)
python3 collector.py &

# Train models
python3 preprocess.py
python3 train.py

# Start live scoring
python3 score.py &
```

The server reads `ml/data/latest_scores.json` on each graph request using a mtime cache. No Python API calls at runtime — just a file read.

---

## Deployment

### Environment (server/.env)

```env
PORT=3001
INGEST_TOKEN=your-strong-secret-here
POLLING_INTERVAL_MS=5000
SOCK_SHOP_BASE_URL=http://<your-ec2-ip>:80
```

### systemd (production)

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Microservice Mapper Server
After=network-online.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/microservice-mapper/server
ExecStart=/usr/bin/npm run start
Restart=always
Environment=PORT=3001
Environment=INGEST_TOKEN=your-secret

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### NGINX (SSL + static files)

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name mapper.yourdomain.com;

    location /api { proxy_pass http://localhost:3001; }
    location /ws {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
    location / {
        root /home/ubuntu/microservice-mapper/client/dist;
        try_files $uri /index.html;
    }
}
```

## Known Limitations

- **Connection sampling, not per-request tracing** — the sweep counts sockets in `ESTABLISHED` and `TIME_WAIT`. `TIME_WAIT` lingers ~60s, so short request/response cycles between two sweeps are usually still caught, but nothing here is a per-request record
- **No per-edge latency or error rate** — `edge.metrics` is `null` in a Docker/SSH deployment. Edge heat is graded on observed connection volume (`activity.samplesPerMin`), which is a concurrency proxy, not HTTP load
- **HTTP/1.1 log parsing only** — no HTTP/2 or gRPC log parsing
- **Linux targets only** — `/proc/net/tcp` is Linux-specific
- **No auto-retraining** — ML models must be manually retrained as data accumulates
- **Single backend instance** — no built-in clustering
