   * ghcr.io/open-telemetry/demo:3.0.0-frontend, a distroless image whose

   * collectObservedEdges treats a non-zero exit as "skip this service", so
   * frontend's outbound connections were invisible 100% of the time —
   * permanently, not intermittently.
   *
   * That mattered more than it sounds: frontend is the service that actually
   * calls cart / currency / checkout / shipping / product-catalog when it
   * serves /api/*. So none of those edges could ever be observed, none could
   * ever be discovered from traffic, and no amount of load would ever make
   * them light up — which is exactly the "stress doesn't show in the edges"
   * and "several edges are missing" symptoms.
   *
   * Reading /proc/<hostPid>/net/tcp from the host is the same data (the file
   * is per network namespace either way) and needs nothing whatsoever inside
   * the container, so it works for distroless, scratch and normal images
   * alike. Verified on the live host: no sudo required, and the output
   * format is byte-identical to the old command's, so the parser downstream
